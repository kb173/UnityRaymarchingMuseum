# Unity Raymarching Museum

A demo showing some capabilities of a raymarching renderer in a dreamy aesthetic.

Walk through the wall when the time is right (or not, since there's no collision) and follow the sounds. There are 3 rooms: The start location, the Mandelbulb fractal, and the emergent subtractive art shape.

Base structure and functionality adapted from https://github.com/SebLague/Ray-Marching.
